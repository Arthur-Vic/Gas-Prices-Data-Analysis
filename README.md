# Data Analysis on Gas Prices Over Time

This repository contains an educational study on gas prices in Brazil from the years 2004 to 2021. The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends, patterns, and fluctuations in gas prices over this period.

## Skills

With this study I am aiming to work on my Data Analysis skills and learn along the way.
For this project I've used Pandas along Jupyter Notebook in order to work with and see the changes made on to the csv file.
Also, for presenting the data, I made a simple Power Bi Dashboard for ease of navigation and filtering of information.

## Dataset

The study utilizes a dataset of gas prices collected obtained from Kaggle at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matheusfreitag/gas-prices-in-brazil>. The dataset includes pricing for various regions in Brazil.

## Analysis and Visualizations

As I said earlier, I made a simple Power Bi Dashboard for ease of navigation and filtering of information as seen below:
