# Data Analysis on Gas Prices Over Time

This repository contains an educational study on gas prices in Brazil from the years 2004 to 2021. The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize the trends, patterns, and fluctuations in gas prices over this period.

## Dataset

The study utilizes a dataset of gas prices collected obtained from Kaggle at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matheusfreitag/gas-prices-in-brazil>. The dataset includes pricing for various regions in Brazil.

## Analysis and Visualizations

As of today I cleaned up the data for ease of use and visualization, to be processed in the future.
